--ADMINCMD API FOR SD-SECURITY AND OTHER SD-STORAGE SOFTWARE--
--------------------------------------------------------------

-AdminCMD.exe-
--------------
This EXE is an upgrade to the default AdminCMD API in SD-Security, it improves the performance by 45% and is protected against source-modification attacks.
In order for you to use this EXE, it needs to be launched as an administrator.

TO ACTIVATE THE ADMINCMD API:
--------------------------
1. Open 'AdminCMD_Launcher.exe'
2. Click on 'Activate Background Service'
3. Wait until a window appears, asking you if you want to continue, click on 'yes' (You may have to enter a password)
4. FINISHED: The AdminCMD service has been activated
(You can also do this manually if you want: Right click 'AdminCMD.exe', select 'Run as administrator' and then click 'Yes')

TO DEACTIVATE THE ADMINCMD API:
1. Open 'AdminCMD_Launcher.exe'
2. Click on 'Deactivate Background Service'
3. FINISHED: The AdminCMD service has been deactivated


WHAT THIS ENABLE ME TO DO?
