!!| UNRESOLVED BUG FOUND! Bug 101
!!| :
!!| Bug Applies To All Drives With FAT/FAT32 System (Includes 99.9% Of Memory Sticks And Some External Hard drives)
!!| SD-Security Is Less Secure On FAT/FAT32 Drives Than On NTFS Drives, Due To Permissions On A Fat/Fat32 Drive Can't Be Changed (No Permissions)
!!| To Fix Bug:
!!| 1. Backup Any Files On Your Drive (A Tip: In The Folder Options, Tick The Boxes "Show Hidden Files And Folders" & "Show Hidden System Files" So You Can See SD-Security's Settings And Data Folder)
!!| 2. Right Click On Your Drive In Windows Explorer And Select "Format"
!!| 3. Select The File System "NTFS" (If You Can't See NTFS, Then You Will Have To Wait Until We Find A Fix (e.g. Use Encryption, But We Don't Want To Include Any Third Party Software, So We Would Have To Come Up With A Whole Different System To Secure Everything)/ Ignore The Bug)
!!| 4. Then Click On Format
!!| 5. Restore All Your Files From The Backup You Made Earlier (Step 1) And Open SD-Security
!!| 6. Bug Fixed :)

^1.0.9 - 27/4/15^
**| Fixed SD-Security Crashing When The EXE Is Not Named 'SD-Security.exe'
!!| DEV 2: Updated The Code To Rename SD-Security Application To SD-Security.exe:
   !!| If There Isnt A Application Called SD-Security.exe Copy Self- Fails Here Because Its Impossible To Copy The EXE (No Way Of Getting Name, Due To The SD-Security Is Actually Being Run By A Batch File And Run In The EXE (EXE Is Like CMD.EXE, No Way Of Getting Name Without Using Advanced Batch Code)), Not The Batch File Of SD-Security

^1.1.9 - 30/5/15^
++| Added Error Screens To Data Vault:
!!| 1. When There Is No Permissions To Lock Data Vault
!!| 2. When The Data Vault Can't Be Decrypted Because The Permissions Can't Be Changed Because Of The Owner Property
++| Added Options To Encrypt Data Vault:
   !!| 1. Encrypt It Without Changing Permissions
   !!| 2. Encrypt It Using Permissions (This Feature Is 95% Secure When Plugging The Drive With The Data Vault Onto A Different Computer)
   !!| !. This Feature Automatically Hides The Menu When The File System Is FAT (But It Still Attempts To Do The Advanced Encryption)
**| Fixed A Bug With The 'Bug 101' Error Checker (The Varible %Bug_101_Vuln% Always Had The Value 'yes')
!!| There Is 2377 Lines Of Code

^1.1.9B - 31/5/15^
++| Added Beep API, Beep API Allows SD-Security To Play A Beep Sound From The Command Prompt. Uses 'echo 3|choice /n' To Produce Three Beeps, Try It Out (Beep API Is Open-Source)
**| Changed & Added A Few Remarks To The Script (You Won't Notice It)
!!| Removing Some Old Code In ^1.1.9C^ / ^1.3.0^ (Portable Apps Code And Some Old Code Vulnerable To Attacks)

^1.2.0 - 3/6/15-4/6/15^
!!| Security Improved By 150%
++| Added 'Hide Password' Option (To SD-Settings.ini), When This Option Is Enabled It Will Hide (Mask) The Password You Enter In The Sign In Screen And It Enables Auto Login (Login When Correct Password Entered)
++| Added A.P.O Menu (Advanced Power Options) Into The Other Menus, A.P.O Allows You To Time A Shutdown To The PC (In Seconds)
++| Added Command Line Switches, Allows You To Jump To A Page By Using A Command
**| Added A Copyright Symbol After SD-Security In The Title Bar
**| Updated SD-Security's Description (Right Click File, Details Tab)
!!| SD-Settings.ini Needs To Be Reset After This Update, Make A Text File Called 'safemode.txt' Launch SD-Security And Select Reset Preferences
!!| SD-Installer Needs To Be Updated


!!  Security Downs And Ups When Using 'Hide Password' Option |
1. When You Enter A Incorrect Username In And Hide Password Option Is Enabled, Then You Won't Be Able To See Any Hack Attempts In Log
2. The Fact That Autologin Is Enabled, Compromises Security Because People Could Test The Password Eg. Enter A, If Not Signed In Then Enter Another Letter/Number... Though This Would Take Some Time
^But There Are More Positives Than Negitives:^
1. User Has To Keep On Re-Launching SD-Security (To Enter A New Password) So You Would See The Unusual Behaviour In The Log
2. Nobody Can See The Password You Enter, Good When You Have Someone Looking At You Entering The Password (Except For The Brief Second When You Enter A New Character)
3. The History Of The Up/Down Arrow Doesn't Exist Because To Enter The Password You Never Press Enter
^Other Things:^
1. Copy And Paste Is Disabled (If You Paste Something, Only The First Letter Gets Pasted In)
2. Typing Speed Isn't As Fast (This Is Because When You Press A Character, SD-Security Is Running In The Background To Hide It)
^Security Outcome:^
Security Ups      : 3
Security Downs    : 2
++Security Outcome: +1 / +100%|
**Hacking Speed Was Decreased By: 50%|
Total Outcome:
##--SD-Security's Security Strength Was Increased By 150%|##

^1.2.0B - 12/6/15^
**| Secured The Login System By 50% (Uses setlocal Command, This Means That If SD-Security Crashes (Hacker Could Do This Easily) Whilst It Was Called In A CMD Window The Password Variables Were Still Intact So This Fix Secures The Password)
++| Starting To Switch To 'Call' Command Rather Than 'Goto' Command Because Its More Efficient
**| Fixed Multiple Bugs That Occurred To SD-Security When Adding The Above Two Features
!! Security Strength Increased By 50% |

^1.2.0C - 13/6/15^
++| Added Command Switch Help Screen
--| Removed Long Code (This Is Code That Can Be Simplified By Using Newer Commands Or Commands Put Together Called A API)(This Reduces Size)

^1.2.1 - 13/6/15^ ## DEV 2 Bug
++| Added Time Format API, This API Basically Takes And Formats The Date And Time Variables, Useful For Displaying Easy-To-Read Time And Date
++| Added Statistics, This Allows You To See (Inside SD-Security) The Last Computer/Username/Time/Date That Opened SD-Security
++| Added Counting System Into SD-Security, You Can Now See How Many Times SD-Security Has Been Opened
!!| Statistics Feature Generates A File In SDS_Files Called ^SD-Statistics.ini^, This File ONLY Logs Stuff So There Is No Settings In It
!!| DEV5 : When Making The Statistics Feature The Rest Of SD-Security Malfunctioned, So This Statistics Feature Is A Developer Feature, Advised To Stay Version 1.2.0 Until The Rest Of SD-Security Is Stable

^1.2.1B - 14/6/15^
!!|^YAY^!!| SD-Security's Size Was Reduced By 249 Lines Of Code / 6KB From Version ^1.2.1A^ & A Few Patches Have Been Applied To DEV5 So Update,Update,Update!
!!| Size Still Went Up 2KB Because Of All The New Features And API's
**| SD-Security's Was Reduced By Using Newer Commands, Removed 100+ Lines By Call'ing The Theme Background And Removed Loads From The Startup Of SD-Security
**| :( SD-Security's Startup Speed Increased 1.2.0 Was 3 Seconds Now 4-5 Seconds, Reason: Though Call'ing Is More Efficient At Writing Advanced Scripts It Is Slower Than Goto'ing Because Goto'ing Is More Direct And Also Because Of Some Of The New Features
**| Updated The Text Input Text (The Little Color Block With A : On The End)
**| Patches For DEV5: Fixed SD-Hotspot Not Working, Fixed When Exiting It Sometimes Crashes Without Showing The Exit Screen (Win 32 bit Only! We Think Its Because Of The Memory, So We Used Commando API)
**| Removed Flickering Of The Loading Text At Startup
++| New API; Commando , This Allows SD-Security To Perform A Command In A Seperate Window, Thus Removing The Wait Time For The Command & Not Returning Any Errorlevel's
**| Now The Bad Processes Are Killed With A Commando Command, So It Doesn't Show Any Text On The "Loading..." Screen
++| Added SD-Settings.ini Troubleshooting When It Is Non-Readable (This Means That The User Doesn't Have To Boot Into Safemode When SD-Security Crashes)
++| Added SD-Settings.ini Troubleshooting When It Needs Updating (Now When A Feature Is Added To The SD-Settings.ini File It Will Automatically Tell You That You Need To Reset It)
++++| Adding Loads More API's That Use Call'ing
!!| When SD-Security Is Launched, A Command Window Opens And Closes Quickly, This Window Is Actually The Commando API Running

^1.2.2 - 15/6/15^
++| Check-OS API, This Feature Allows SD-Security To Get The Current Windows Version
++| Wait API, This Feature Allows SD-Security To Wait A Certain Amount Of Time (This Command Uses The PING Command BUT Doesn't Actually Ping Anything, See The Notes In The Demo)
++| Added OS Version Text Into The Log, Uses Check-OS API
++| Added Small Fading Animation To Exit Screen And Loading Screen, Uses Wait API
**| Updated The Loading Screen
--| Removed The Last Of The Un-Added Feature's Code (Research Shows That It Is Impossible To Get One Of The Features To Work WITHOUT Using Additional CMD Files, We're Not Going To Use Any Additional Files Because Of The Compatibility)

^1.2.2B - 18/6/15^
++| Serial API, This Allows User To Pinpoint The Exact Computer Drive SD-Security Was Launched On (Recorded In The Security Log)
**| Fixed A Bug With The Security Log And The Process When Making The SDS_Files Folder

^1.2.2C - 20/6/15^
**| DEV 2 Security Bug: Fixed Security Issue That Shows Password (By Typing '|echo %password%'), Fixed By Not Showing The Invalid Command
**| Updated The Smaller Sizes Of The SD-Security Logo To Look More Detailed (1-2 Hour(s) Of Work Applied)
++| BETA FEATURE: Added Desktop.ini API, This Should Show SD-Security On The Folder SD-Security Is Installed On (It Doesn't Update The File Though Because If It Was Installed On The Desktop It Would Corrupt The One Required By Windows)
--| Removed Portable Apps Launcher From Source Code (10-20 Lines) (Removed Code Because It Poses A Security Threat To The Password + Reduces Size)

^1.2.3 - 21/6/15^
!!| File Size=575KB (0.575MB / 57.5% Of A Megabyte)
**| Fixed Security Bug In The SD-Hotspot Page, Shows Password (DEV 2 Security Bug)
**| BETA Fix On The Time And Date In The Log (Sometimes It Displays It Wrong, This Is Very Odd Because It Randomly Happens With No Reason Why)
**| Changed The (R) Sign To A (C) Sign In The Title (Confusion With The (C) Because If You Use A Copyright Sign In The Source Code, It's Displayed As A (R) Sign)
   **| Also Changed The All Rights Reserved Text To '(C) 2015 SD-Security'
**| Added A Bit More Curve To The Top Of The 16 x 16 SD-Security Icon (One With The ^SD^ Text)

**| FIXED SD-Security Crashing On The First Time It Runs (See The Third Fix Below)
**| Re-Coded A Few Sections Of SD-Security To Improve Speed & Stability:
   !!| 1. Wait API, Now It Doesn't Use The Ping Command To Work, It Simply Loops A Loop Until The Wait Number Is The Same As Th Amount Of Times It Has Looped
   !!| 2. Screen Size, Now It Simply Call's ':SetWindow' To Set The Window Size To The Default Window Size
   !!| 3. Method In Which The SD-Statistics File Is Handled To Improve Stability And To Remove The Error In Which The SD-Statistics Screen Didn't Show Any Data
**| Updated Sign Out Screen (Sign In Screen When Signed In)

^1.2.4B - 25/6/15^
++|   Added A Screen Telling You To Click 'Yes' On The UAC Window When Requesting ADMIN Permissions

!!| SD-Security Now Can Be Installed In The Program Files Folder
!!| Fact: SD-Security Processes 500+ Lines Of Code In 4 Seconds EVERY Time You Open It!

--   |!!| Time API Is Currently In A Dev State ^(DEV 5)^, Due To The Number Of Times It Randomly Plays Up     !!|--   |
--   |!!| This Means That SD-Security Is In A BETA Stage, Until This Bug Can Be Solved **|UPDATE: SOLVED (2/7/15)!!|--   |

^1.2.5C - 1/7/15^
++| Randomo API, Allows SD-Security To Get A Completely Random Number Of Any Length, Uses A Formula Where If The Random Number = 7 Set The Number To The Current Millisecond In The Time
**| Updated The Security Breach Screens To Show A Error Sometimes, This Uses The Randomo API (We Just Have To Include The Security Breach Feature ;) )
**| Updated Some Comments (Remarks) And Added A Couple
**| Updated The DEV 5 Code (DEV 5 Warning Still Intact) We Are Going To Be Running Some Tests On A Virtual Machine To Try And Resolve This DEV State

^1.2.6 - 2/7/15^
**| Improvements On The SD-Security Icon (Low Resolution Versions, Improved The Shape Of The Skull)
**| Fixed SD-Security Not Setting The Window Title, Colour etc. When Launching Safemode With The Command Switch
**| Time API Fixed (-12 Lines, This Also Speeds Up SD-Security)
   !!| Reason Why It Played Up Is Due To The Format Of The Date & Time Changes According To The Language And User Preferences
   !!| If User Has A 3rd Party Date And Time Handler Installed SD-Security Will Attempt To Read The Data BUT Will Probably Fail
   ++| Added A Few More Variables So SD-Security Can Get More Out Of The Time/Date
   **| Speed When Updating The Time And Date Decreased A Bit
   **| Fixed A Bug That Can Show Different Information Between Different Display Types (This Could Have Caused The Date And Time Variable To Be Blank)
   **| Removed The 0 From The Month Number (EG. Before Date Format Was Like: ^2/07/2015^ Now Its Been Shortened: ^2/7/2015^
   **| Fixed A DEV 3 Security Bug, This Security Error Occurs 2 Times (SD-Security Used The Time&Date Variable To Get The Time/Date
++| 1.2.6 Is A Stable Version


^1.2.6B - 3/7/15^
**| Fixed Some Bugs Relating To The Time And Date When Recording The Safemode Screen In The Log
**| Fixed A DEV 2 Bug That Occurs From ^V.1.2.1^ With The Time API, The Time And Date Variables Can Be Tampered With So SD-Security Uses 'Time /t' And 'Date /t' To Get The Time And Date
++| Instead Of Just Showing The Updated Screen It Will Show A Downgraded Screen According To What Action You Performed

^1.2.6C - 4/7/15^
++| RealTime Encryption API BETA, This Allows SD-Security To Encrypt Some Text In Realtime. This Feature Might Be Added To Encrypto To Provide Extra Security

^1.2.8 - 28/7/15^
**| Fixed When Signing In With USB, SD-Security Crashes (Missing Escape Sign For Escaping A Pipe When Writing To The Log)
**| Re-Fixed Window Size Being To Small When Passing Commands To SD-Security
++| Crash Helper API, This Feature Took Blood And Sweat To Make But Here It Is. This API Tells The User If The SD-Security Window Crashes
   !!| The Crashed Screen Will Always Show Unless SD-Security Is Exited The Correct Way (exit 999)
   !!| So This Screen Could Show IF A EXIT COMMAND HAS'NT GOT AN EXIT CODE
   !!| This Feature Works By: Call'ing CMD, And CMD Is Call'ing SD-Security, So That Means If SD-Security Crashes, Code Can Still Be Run. The Reason It Calls CMD Is Because Normally Call'ing SD-Security Crashes Everything
   !!| This Feature Has To Control /? Command Switch Option Because Adding /? To A Program When Call'ing, Displays The Help Of The Call Command
   !!| Safemode Skips This Feature (Reason: Because This API Could Fail If New Features Are Added That Conflict With This)
   !!| This Feature Depends On CMD.EXE So It Could Reduce Compatability On Older PC's
--| Feature Downgraded, Multiple Bugs Found When Testing The Code, This API Upgrade Will Have To Be Re-Wrote, **|RE-ADDED In V.1.3.5 (18/9/15)
--| **| Updated The Hide-Password API

   **| Fixed Favicon.ico Being Visible For 3+ Seconds When SD-Security Is Starting
**| Updated SD-Security Uninstaller (In Safemode), It Allows The User To Specify The Name Of The EXE. Also Updated The Method Of Deleting The EXE (Ues The Commando API To Provide A A New Window)
++| Developer Options, (Can Be Found In Other Menu) This Allows The User To Do Developer Actions Like, Crash SD-Security, Reboot To Safemode, More Features Coming In Later Updates
## Two ^DEV 3^ Instances Found, Unresolved (%username%, %computername%)

^1.2.8C - 1/8/15^
!!| 2 New Files To The SDS_Files Folder:
   !!| SD-Updater.ini    : The Settings File For The SD-Updater API
   !!| LatestVersion.ini : A File Which Is Downloaded From The Web Every Time The SD-Updater API Checks For Updates. This File Displays The Latest Version Of SD-Security That Is On The SD-Updater Server
++| SD-Updater API, You Can Now Check For Updates To SD-Security Over The Internet Or Over The WiFi. This Feature Allows You To Update All SD-Security Installations To One Version (This Feature Is Still In BETA)
   !!| This Feature Uses The Internet, If You Don't Have Any Internet Connection This Feature Will Display An Error Screen
   !!| This Feature Isn't Compatible With Most Windows XP Computers And Some PC's With Powershell Disabled. An Error Screen Will Show When This Is Detected
   !!| This Feature Could Have MILLIONS Of Different Errors, But For Now It Just Has Two Universal Error Screens
**| Updated The Other Screen, It Now Has 'Folders', All The Stuff Has Been Moved Into These 'Folder' Screens
++| Notify API, This API Allows SD-Security To Display Notifications In The Notification Area With Custom Icons, Text And Titles
   !!| Uses Powershell, If Powershell Isn't Installed, Then Nothing Will Show

^1.2.9 - 2/8/15^
!!| If Updating From ^1.2.8C^ You May Have The SD-Updater Server Misconfigured (Delete 'SDS_Files\SD-Updater.ini' To Reset)
++| Added SD-Updater Servers (Hosted On Dropbox)
   !!| Dropbox (Default): http://www.dropbox.com/s/r6gyfh9kc9sqy3t/SD-Security.exe?dl=1 For The SD-Security Executable
   !!| Dropbox (Default): http://www.dropbox.com/s/kue59qjeasq0tp7/OnlineVersion.txt?dl=1 For The Online Version File
**| Improvements To The SD-Updater Updating System (Deletes The OnlineVersion.txt When 'Check For Updates' Is Run, This Stops It From Saying Anything After An Error Occurs)

^1.2.9B - 4/8/15^
** Compiler Updated |
   !!| The Compiler Has Been Updated To V.2.3.1, This Update Required Some Updates To The Command Switch's Code:
      **| The Command Switch API Has Been Updated, No Longer Uses '%*' To Get Switch Instead Uses '%1', Reason: Bat To Exe Changes The '%*' Variable To Include The EXE Name, This Was Causing SD-Security To Crash
         **| This Also Means That Only The First Word Of The Command Switch Is Reads ('%*' Would Display All The Command Switches Entered)
      **| This Update Enables SD-Security To Overcome Bug 100 (EXE Name)
++| The SD-Security EXE Has Been Signed Using An SD-Storage Application Certificate - But You Need To Install The Certificate If You Want Windows To Recognise It As A Trusted Publisher (Reason: This Is Open-Source Software So We Won't Buy A Profesional Certificate For SD-Security)
   !!| This Certificate Is Valid From 3/8/15 to 3/8/20

^1.2.9C - 6/8/15^
**| Fixed APO (Advanced Power Options) Bug That Stops The Basic Timer From Working On Some PC's
**| Updated The Lower Quality Version Of The SD-Security Icon And Updated The Favicon.ico With A New Design Of The USB In The Middle, Added A Windows Logo In The Bottom Right (To Show That The Drive Uses A Windows Operating System) And Made The SD-Security Icon In The Bottom Left Clear On All The Sizes

^1.3.0B - 14/8/15^
**| Session Manager Updated Currently !!STABLE!|
   **| Fixed A Space Being Added Onto The End Of All Variables
   **| Fixed Multiple Bugs
   ++| Added Two Settings For The Session Manager:
      !!| To Disable Auto-Restore, Create A File Named 'DisableAutoRestore.txt' (Or With Any Other Extension). Auto-Restore Is Default Enabled, Because It Speeds Up The Booting Time. It Is Recommended That You Keep It Enabled, But You Don't Have To
      !!| To Enable Auto-Save Permanently, Create A File Named 'DefaultEnable.txt' (Or With Any Other Extension). This Feature COULD Cause SD-Security To Crash, Due To The Fact It Never Refreshes The Info. SD-Security Won't Alert You About Any Error While This Feature Is On Enabled. SD-Security Will Only Automatically Restore Though, If You Exit By Selecting 'Exit' On The Home Screen
   ++| Added Entry In The Safemode Screen To Clear The Saved Sessions And Clear The Settings For This API
++| File Encrypter API, This API Could Be Merged Into/Replace The RealTime Encryption API
